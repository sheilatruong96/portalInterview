For Task 2, I decided to use a dictionary to store my data. I put all the events in a dictionary where the event is the key and the date and time is the value. Then I would go through each of the events and put each event that have the same date together. Next, I decided to loop through each of the events that have the same date so I can compare the time. I want to compare the times and see if they interfere with one another then output that event into the resulting list.
